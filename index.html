            <h1>More violence in Manipur: Mobs try to torch houses of BJP leaders, dispersed by security forces</h1>
            <p>According to sources, a huge mob gathered near Thongju, in Imphal East, at about 10.40 pm on Friday and attempted to vandalise the residence of BJP Minister Biswajit Singh. The mob was dispersed by Rapid Action Force (RAF) personnel.
                There were at least two other instances of mob build-up. While a mob of 200-300 people reportedly gathered around the BJP office at Singjamei in Imphal a little after midnight, there was a separate attempt to vandalise the residence of state BJP president A Sharda Devi in Imphal West. In both instances, the crowd was dispersed by Army and RAF personnel.</p>

            <p>Skirting pointed questions on his party's view of a grand united Opposition front for next year's general elections, Mr Yadav maintained his only slogan for Uttar Pradesh is "Defeat 80, Remove BJP".

                "The BJP will be defeated in all 80 Lok Sabha seats in UP if bigger national parties back us," Akhilesh Yadav said, stressing that he has always maintained that the seat distribution should be decided keeping in mind whichever alliance partner is strongest in a particular state.</p>

            <h1>India would not have been partitioned if Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose was there: NSA Doval</h1>
            <p>"From 1950 to 1962 there was an idea to disband the Army because we had gained Independence. If we started building up our defence, probably the development of 1962 might not have happened. We were short of equipment, soldiers, short of accessibility in areas that we had to defend, and probably we did not have proper planning,‚Äù Mr. Doval said. </p>
